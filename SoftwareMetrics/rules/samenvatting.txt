BEST PRACTICES
use interfaces i.p.v. ArrayList or HashMap
Substitute calls to size() == 0 (or size() != 0, size() > 0, size() < 1) with calls to isEmpty()

CODE STYLE
'm_db' doesn't match '[a-z][a-zA-Z0-9]*'
Avoid variables with short names like db
Parameter 'catalog' is not assigned and could be declared final
Avoid excessively long variable names like prev_iter_itemsets
Package name contains upper case characters
Avoid short class names like Cart

DESIGN
TransactionDB.java:17:	A method/constructor should not explicitly throw java.lang.Exception
Core/Cart.java:50:	These nested if statements could be combined

DOCUMENTATION
Header comments are required
Field comments are required
Public method and constructor comments are required
Catalog.java:19:	Document empty constructor

performance
Eclat.java:36:	Avoid instantiating new objects inside loops    //multiple  
TransactionDB.java:21:	Avoid instantiating new objects inside loops //multiple
